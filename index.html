<h2>Professional experience</h2>


<h3>January 2015 - now:
    R&D engineer at <a href="http://www.idioplatform.com/">idio</a>, London, UK</h3>

<h3>January 2012 - December 2013:
    Software engineer at RenaissanceRe, Dublin, Ireland</h3>

<p>
    I worked in the back-end team in a reinsurance company.
    My team was responsible for providing a risk estimation software that is accurate and fast.
</p>

<h4>Rewrote the compensation software, improving maintainability and extensibility.</h4>

<p>
    This software determines the amount of money the client is entitled to claim,
    given the damage sustained and the contract terms.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        gathered requirements from the business analyst, raising issues when the legacy software behaved inconsistently.
    </li>
    <li>
        software architecture, development, testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        data modelling and migration: designed a new encoding format for contract terms,
        replacing CSV with JSON. Wrote a migration tool to transform the legacy data into the new format.
        Cooperated with the front-end team and users.
    </li>
    <li>
        support and maintenance: interactions with business analysts and underwriters.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Contributed to the geography-aware disaster simulation software.</h4>

<p>
    This software predicts the damage that clients would undergo in different scenarios,
    such as natural catastrophes or human errors.

    I developed targeted tools to model reinsurance coverage for cases of professional fault,
    catering for various parameters such as profession, region and type of insurance.
</p>

<h3>June - August 2011:
    Software engineer at Fermat, Montbonnot, France</h3>

<p>
    Worked on a software that computes the amount of money the bank must put aside as a safety net for its loans.
    Updated the calculation and the database schema according a new regulation.

<h3>Oct 2009 - Dec 2010: Research assistant and part-time teacher,
    Verimag Lab and Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France</h3>

<p>
    Designed and implemented a method for comparing consumption models for wireless sensor networks.
    Studied the data sheet of the embedded radio device CC1100 to confirm the performance of my implementation.
    Gave many presentations of my work in English as well as in French.
</p>

<p>
    Taught 90 hours of tutorials and practical labs:
    C programming, algorithms, regular expressions, automata.
</p>

<div class="tools"> Python, C, Unix shell, Latex, Emacs, Git</div>

<h3>2008 - 2009 (~60h):
    Computer Science tutor at Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France</h3>

<p>
    Taught 1st and 2nd-year university students in groups and individually, alongside my studies.
</p>

<h3>Summer 2008:
    Research intern at the University of Toronto, Canada</h3>

<p>
    Contributed to a software model-checker.
    This tool built an simplified symbolic model of the software and proved properties expressed in mu-calculus.
</p>

<p>
    My team proposed an alternative semantics for mu-calculus,
    which is more precise than the standard semantics,
    i.e. it can prove properties true or false in more cases;
    and it allows symbolic models to be smaller.<br/>

    I implemented the new semantics in the model-checker
    and conducted experiments to assess the benefits.
